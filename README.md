# Christmas Coding Challenge 2024 - JavaScript Solutions

Welcome to my **Christmas Coding Challenge 2024** repo. This project is organized by the **[Women Coding Community](https://womencodingcommunity.com/)**. Through this challenge, I'm committing to solving one [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)  or [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/) problem from the 1st to the 25th of December 2024. 

## ðŸ“… Challenge Goals
- Solve one **LeetCode problem** or **Northcoders katas** in JavaScript everday.
- Focus on a variety of topics such as arrays, strings, dynamic programming, graphs, and more.
- Document each solution with explanations and, if relevant, alternative approaches or optimizations.
